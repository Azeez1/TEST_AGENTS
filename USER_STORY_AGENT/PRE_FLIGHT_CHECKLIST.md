# Pre-Flight Validation Checklist
## Excel + Figma Autonomous Mode

This checklist ensures your Excel + Figma workflow will work correctly **before** you run it.

---

## ✅ **1. Tool Availability Verification**

### **Issue Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **Previous Problem:** Prompts were missing `playwright_scroll_page` and `playwright_get_page_info` tools
- ✅ **Fixed:** Restored both tools to all prompt templates
- 📍 **File:** [research_prompts.py:40-48](research_prompts.py#L40-L48)

### **Verify Now:**
```bash
# Check that tools are listed in prompts
grep -n "playwright_scroll_page" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
grep -n "playwright_get_page_info" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
```

**Expected:** Both commands return matches showing the tools are documented

---

## ✅ **2. Figma Password Authentication**

### **Issue Found & Fixed:**
- ❌ **Previous Problem:** Password instruction was vague: "Enter password: {password} and click Continue"
- ✅ **Fixed:** Added explicit selectors and tool usage
- 📍 **File:** [research_prompts.py:364-370](research_prompts.py#L364-L370)

### **New Password Instruction:**
```
2. If password prompt appears, authenticate:
   - Fill password field: playwright_fill with selector "input[type='password']" and value "{password}"
   - Click continue button: playwright_click with selector "button:has-text('Continue')"
```

### **Verify Now:**
```bash
# Check password instruction is detailed
grep -A3 "If password prompt appears" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
```

**Expected:** Shows the explicit selector instructions

---

## ✅ **3. Iteration Limits**

### **Current Configuration:**
- Max iterations: **20** (was 10)
- 📍 **Files:**
  - [mcp_client.py:106](mcp_client.py#L106) - Default parameter
  - [autonomous_mode.py:330](autonomous_mode.py#L330) - Call site

### **Verify Now:**
```bash
# Check max_iterations value
grep -n "max_iterations.*20" USER_STORY_AGENT/mcp_client.py
grep -n "max_iterations=20" USER_STORY_AGENT/autonomous_mode.py
```

**Expected:** Both show `max_iterations` set to 20

---

## ✅ **4. Figma Detection**

### **Functionality:**
- ✅ Detects Figma URLs with regex: `https?://(?:www\.)?figma\.com/(?:proto|file)/[^\s)\]>]+`
- ✅ Supports both `/proto/` and `/file/` URLs
- ✅ Extracts passwords in multiple formats
- 📍 **File:** [autonomous_mode.py:62-102](autonomous_mode.py#L62-L102)

### **Test Password Detection:**
```python
# Run the test suite
cd USER_STORY_AGENT
python test_figma_detection.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Test 1 - Figma with password: ✓ PASS
Test 2 - Figma without password: ✓ PASS
Test 3 - No Figma URL: ✓ PASS
Test 4 - Excel-like format: ✓ PASS
Test 5 - Alternative password format: ✓ PASS

🎉 All tests passed!
```

---

## ✅ **5. MCP Server Configuration**

### **Verify MCP Config:**
```bash
# Check .mcp.json exists and is configured
cat .mcp.json
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### **Test MCP Server Startup:**
```bash
# Quick server test (press Ctrl+C after 2 seconds)
npx -y @executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server
```

**Expected:** Server starts without errors (you'll see initialization logs)

---

## ✅ **6. Prompt Efficiency Check**

### **Current Strategy:**
- ✅ Uses "KEY screens" not "EACH screen"
- ✅ Includes "Research efficiently to stay within tool iteration limits"
- ✅ Separates exploration from generation: "AFTER you finish exploring..."
- ✅ Prioritizes "breadth over depth"

### **Verify Prompt:**
```bash
# Check for efficiency instructions
grep -n "KEY screens" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
grep -n "breadth over depth" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
grep -n "AFTER you finish exploring" USER_STORY_AGENT/research_prompts.py
```

**Expected:** All three phrases found in the Figma prompt

---

## 🧪 **7. End-to-End Test Plan**

### **Test Case 1: Simple Figma (2-3 screens)**
**Excel Content:**
```
Dashboard Requirements:
- User stats
- Activity feed

Figma: https://figma.com/proto/SIMPLE123
Password: demo123
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ 2-4 user stories generated
- ✅ Completes in 6-10 iterations
- ✅ Stories reference Figma screens
- ✅ No "Unknown tool" errors

### **Test Case 2: Medium Figma (5-7 screens)**
**Excel Content:**
```
E-commerce Flow:
- Product listing
- Product detail
- Cart
- Checkout

Figma: https://figma.com/proto/MEDIUM456
Password: shop-demo
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ 4-6 user stories generated
- ✅ Completes in 12-16 iterations
- ✅ Stories include flow descriptions
- ✅ No max iteration errors

### **Test Case 3: Complex Figma (10+ screens)**
**Excel Content:**
```
Complete Admin Dashboard:
- Users management
- Analytics
- Settings
- Reports
- Notifications

Figma: https://figma.com/proto/COMPLEX789
Password: admin-demo
```

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ 6-10 user stories generated
- ✅ Completes in 16-20 iterations
- ✅ Comprehensive AC with design specs
- ✅ Uses all 20 iterations efficiently

---

## 🚨 **8. Known Issues & Mitigations**

### **Issue 1: Figma Password Prompt Timing**
**Problem:** Password prompt may take 1-2 seconds to appear after navigation

**Mitigation:** Agent autonomously detects when prompt appears (no hardcoded waits needed)

### **Issue 2: Very Long Prototypes (15+ screens)**
**Problem:** May not explore all screens due to iteration limit

**Mitigation:** Agent prioritizes "breadth over depth" - explores KEY representative screens

### **Issue 3: Figma Design System Components**
**Problem:** Agent may not know exact component library names

**Mitigation:** Agent extracts observable component patterns and visual specs

---

## 🎬 **Ready to Test!**

Once all checkboxes above are ✅, your workflow is validated and ready:

1. Create Excel with Figma URL and password
2. Run: `streamlit run USER_STORY_AGENT/app_ui.py`
3. Upload Excel
4. Enable "Browser & Research Mode"
5. Select "Autonomous"
6. Click "Generate Stories"
7. Watch agent auto-detect, navigate, and generate comprehensive stories!

---

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

**If agent still fails:**

1. Check logs for error patterns
2. Verify Figma URL is publicly accessible or password is correct
3. Ensure MCP server started successfully (look for "✓ MCP server ready!")
4. Check iteration count - if hitting 20, may need to simplify requirements
5. Review generated tool calls in logs - should see `playwright_fill`, `playwright_click`, `playwright_press_key`, `playwright_screenshot`

**If password authentication fails:**
1. Manually test Figma URL - does it show password prompt?
2. Verify password is correct
3. Check logs for selector errors
4. Password field should match `input[type='password']`
5. Continue button should contain text "Continue"
