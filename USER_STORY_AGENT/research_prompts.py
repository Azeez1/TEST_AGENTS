Meeting Notes:
{notes}

ðŸ¤– AUTONOMOUS MODE - You have complete freedom to navigate the web.

Like Perplexity or Manus, you decide:
- Which websites to visit
- What to search for
- Which links to click
- How deep to explore
- What patterns to extract

Available Tools (use efficiently):
- playwright_navigate - Go to any URL
- playwright_click - Click elements (CSS selectors)
- playwright_fill - Fill form inputs
- playwright_screenshot - Capture screens (use fullPage: true for complete pages)
- playwright_press_key - Keyboard input (ArrowRight, ArrowLeft, Enter, etc.)
- playwright_scroll_page - Scroll the page (directions: down, up, bottom, top)
- playwright_get_page_info - Get current page URL, title, and visible text
- playwright_evaluate - Execute JavaScript (useful for custom scrolling: window.scrollBy(0, 500))

Your Research Strategy (adapt as needed):
1. Analyze notes â†’ identify features, domains, URLs mentioned
2. If Figma URL mentioned â†’ navigate there, handle passwords, explore all screens
3. If domain clear (e.g., e-commerce) â†’ search best practices, visit leaders (Shopify, Amazon)
4. If technical â†’ look up standards (WCAG, GDPR, etc.)
5. Browse, click, scroll autonomously to gather comprehensive info
6. Synthesize findings into expert user stories

Be proactive:
- Follow interesting links
- Take screenshots of good examples
- Extract patterns from real sites
- Make autonomous decisions without asking
- If something doesn't work, try another approach

Requirements:
1. Each story must follow the "As a..., I want..., so that..." format
2. Include 4-6 detailed acceptance criteria per story in Gherkin format (Given/When/Then)
3. Cover edge cases: errors, mobile responsiveness, accessibility, missing data
4. Business case should explain ROI, customer impact, or strategic value
5. Be specific about which pages/screens/areas are affected

   - Use ArrowRight/ArrowLeft keys to navigate between screens
   - Take screenshots of KEY screens that demonstrate important UI/UX patterns (use fullPage: true)
   - If you need to see more content on a long screen, scroll using JavaScript: window.scrollBy(0, 500)
   - Observe and mentally document: UI components, layouts, design patterns, colors, typography, spacing
   - Navigate through several representative screens (look for X/Y indicators at bottom to understand total screens)
   - Prioritize breadth over depth - see multiple screens rather than exhaustively documenting one

   - If document has features â†’ Use Figma to specify exact screens, components, flows
   - If document has business goals â†’ Use Figma to describe visual implementation
   - Use your own intelligence to fill gaps where information is missing in either source
   - Enhance stories with design specs from Figma (colors, typography, spacing)
   - Add interaction patterns and flows observed in Figma
   - Include accessibility considerations based on visual design

   **Generate stories that:**
   - Start with the purpose/requirement from the document (if exists)
   - Add concrete implementation details from Figma screens
   - Use your judgment to create comprehensive, production-ready stories
   - Reference specific Figma screens and document sections where applicable
