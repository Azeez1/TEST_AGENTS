CRITICAL: Use Explicit/Detailed AC format with the following COMPLETE GUIDELINES:

## üéØ KEEP IT SIMPLE (DEFAULT - Use This 95% of the Time)

**TARGET:** 30-50 lines total, 2,500-4,500 characters
**STRUCTURE:** 3-4 indentation levels max (1, a, i, 1)
**SECTIONS:** 4-7 main numbered sections
**FOCUS:** Core functionality only

### Universal Checklist - Every AC Must Cover:
‚úÖ Trigger/Entry Point: What initiates this functionality?
‚úÖ Inputs: What data/information is required?
‚úÖ Processing/Logic: What happens during execution?
‚úÖ Outputs: What's produced? (screen, data, notification, file)
‚úÖ Validation Rules: What must be verified/checked?
‚úÖ Error Handling: What happens when things fail?
‚úÖ Edge Cases: Unusual scenarios covered?
‚úÖ Permissions: Who can access this? (roles, authentication)
‚úÖ State Changes: What changes in the system?
‚úÖ Success Criteria: How do we know it worked?

### What to INCLUDE:
‚úÖ What displays/happens on screen
‚úÖ User interactions and results
‚úÖ Conditional logic (if/then statements)
‚úÖ Validation and error messages with exact text
‚úÖ Navigation flows and redirects
‚úÖ Required vs optional fields (mark explicitly)
‚úÖ User states (guest/logged in, empty states)
‚úÖ Tooltips and modals
‚úÖ Pre-populated data
‚úÖ Cross-references to related stories: (See [Story Name])
‚úÖ Responsive behavior summary (desktop/mobile differences if important)

### What to AVOID:
‚ùå Design implementation details ("swipe left" ‚Üí use "option to access")
‚ùå Vague statements ("manage items" ‚Üí use "Copy, Delete, or Select")
‚ùå Pixel-perfect design specs (fonts, colors, exact spacing)
‚ùå Exhaustive analytics event lists
‚ùå Detailed accessibility specs (summarize in Notes)
‚ùå CMS/admin implementation details
‚ùå A/B testing requirements
‚ùå Social features (unless core to story)
‚ùå Specific timings (unless critical - say "loads quickly")

### REQUIRED NOTES SECTION:
Always include a "Notes:" section at the end covering:
- Performance: Target load times, optimization notes
- Accessibility: Screen reader, keyboard navigation summary
- Analytics: Key events to track (high-level)
- Future Enhancements: v2 features, nice-to-haves
- Technical Hints: Caching, API considerations
- Open Questions: Items needing clarification

### Example Structure (Use As Template):

1. The [Page/Feature Name] displays:
   a. [UI Element/Section Name]
      i. [Field name] (Required)
      ii. [Field name] (Optional)
      iii. [Behavior or condition]
         1. If [condition], then [result]
         2. Error message: "[exact text]"
   b. [Next UI Element]
      i. [Details...]
   c. [Button/Action]
      i. Disabled if [condition]
      ii. Selecting will redirect to [Destination]

2. User States:
   a. Guest users: [behavior]
   b. Logged-in users: [behavior]
   c. Empty state: Display message "[text]"

3. Validation Rules:
   a. [Field] validation
      i. If [invalid condition], display error: "[message]"
   b. Form submission
      i. All Required fields must be completed

4. Navigation:
   a. Success: Redirect to [Page]
   b. Cancel: Return to [Previous Page] (See [Story Name])
   c. Back button: Navigate to [Page]

5. Responsive Behavior:
   a. Desktop: [key differences]
   b. Mobile: [key differences if significant]

Notes:
- Performance: [target metrics]
- Accessibility: [keyboard navigation, screen readers]
- Analytics: [key events to track]
- Future: [planned enhancements]

### Common Patterns to Use:

**For Validation:**
i. If the user does not [required action] they will receive an error message informing them that [specific error text]

**For Navigation:**
i. Selecting will redirect the user to [Destination] ([URL]) to [purpose]

**For Conditionals:**
a. If [condition], then:
   i. [Outcome 1]
   ii. [Outcome 2]

**For Cross-References:**
ii. [Action] (See [Related User Story Name])

**For Modals:**
d. Tool Tip
   i. Selecting will display a modal that [describes purpose]
      1. [Content element]
      2. [Button/Link]
         a. Selecting will [action]

**For Pre-population:**
i. [Field name] will pre-populate with [data source/default value]

**For Permissions:**
a. User must be [authenticated/have role] to access this feature
b. If user does not have permission:
   i. User sees: [error message OR redirect to login]
