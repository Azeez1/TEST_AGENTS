## Federal-Specific: Neutral Past Performance

If you have **no prime contracts** or **no relevant CPARS**:

> Our company has no adverse or directly relevant CPARS history as a prime. Under **FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iv)**, lack of past performance may not be evaluated favorably or unfavorably. To reduce Government risk, we present named key personnel with directly relevant experience (see resumes) and a subcontractor, [Partner], performing [major/critical tasks] with proven performance on comparable programs per **FAR 15.305(a)(2)(iii)**. Our transition plan and QA controls ensure Day-1 readiness with measurable SLAs.

**Then:**
- Provide key personnel resumes with their prior relevant work
- Provide subcontractor PPQs/case studies
- Emphasize transition plan, risk register, QA

## Enterprise-Specific
- Lead with outcomes (ROI, efficiency gains)
- Include client testimonials (with permission)
- Emphasize change management success
- Security/compliance achievements

## Proof Requirements

- Client permission for testimonials
