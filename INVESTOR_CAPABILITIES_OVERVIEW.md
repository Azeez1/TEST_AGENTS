## Governance & Best Practices

### Agent Governance Framework
Our platform includes comprehensive governance rules:

**Tool Restrictions:**
- MCP tool calls require explicit permission
- Bash commands governed by safety protocols
- File operations (read/write/edit) require user context awareness

**Quality Standards:**
- All code must pass security audit (security-auditor)
- Test coverage minimum 80% (test-orchestrator)
- Documentation required for all features (technical-writer)
- Independent verification before delivery (supervisor)

**Invocation Best Practices:**
- Use coordinator agents (CTO, router-agent) for complex tasks
- Chain specialists for multi-step workflows
- Verify completion with supervisor for critical work

### Documentation
- `AGENT_GOVERNANCE_RULES.md` - Governance framework
- `AGENT_INVOCATION_BEST_PRACTICES.md` - Proper usage patterns
