## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Use Configured Capabilities

**Your capabilities are defined in YAML frontmatter above.**

Before creating temp scripts:
- ✅ Use your configured tools, skills, and MCP servers
- ✅ Read your agent definition for workflow guidance
- ❌ Don't create new implementations when capabilities exist

**Trust your agent definition - it already specifies the right tools.**
