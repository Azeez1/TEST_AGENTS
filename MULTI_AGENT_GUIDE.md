# ü§ñ The Definitive Guide to Using Your Multi-Agent Systems

## The Simple Truth

**You have 18 perfectly defined AI agents ready to use RIGHT NOW.**

No Python code required. No orchestrators. No complex setup.

Just **talk to Claude Code (me)** and I'll become those agents.

---

## How It Actually Works

### The Core Concept

1. Your `.claude/agents/*.md` files are **instructions for me (Claude Code)**
2. When you invoke an agent, **I read that file**
3. **I adopt that agent's persona** and follow its instructions
4. **I use only the tools** specified for that agent
5. **I can delegate to other agents** if needed

### You Have 18 Agents

**MARKETING_TEAM (13 agents):**
- router-agent - Coordinator
- copywriter - Blog & article writing
- editor - Content review
- social-media-manager - Social posts
- visual-designer - Image generation
- video-producer - Video creation
- seo-specialist - SEO & research
- email-specialist - Email campaigns
- gmail-agent - Email sending
- pdf-specialist - PDF creation
- presentation-designer - PowerPoint
- analyst - Performance analysis
- content-strategist - Campaign planning

**TEST_AGENT (5 agents):**
- test-orchestrator - Testing coordinator
- unit-test-agent - Unit test generation
- integration-test-agent - Integration tests
- edge-case-agent - Edge case identification
- fixture-agent - Pytest fixtures

## How to Invoke Agents

### Method 1: Explicit Invocation (Recommended for Learning)

Tell me exactly which agent to use:

```
You: "Use the copywriter subagent to write a blog post about AI trends"

Me: [reads MARKETING_TEAM/.claude/agents/copywriter.md]
    [adopts that persona]
    [follows its instructions]
    [uses get_brand_voice tool]
    [writes the blog post]
```

**Template:**
```
Use the [agent-name] subagent to [task description]
```

### Method 2: Automatic Delegation (Natural)

Just describe what you want:

```
You: "Write a blog post about AI trends"

Me: [recognizes this is content writing]
    [proactively invokes copywriter subagent]
    [does everything from Method 1]
```

**I'll automatically:**
- Recognize what type of task it is
- Choose the right agent based on descriptions
- Invoke that agent for you

### Method 3: Agent Chaining (Advanced)

Agents can delegate to each other:

```
You: "Use the router-agent to create a complete marketing campaign"

Me: [becomes router-agent]
    [reads the user's request]
    [decides I need multiple specialists]

    [invokes copywriter subagent for blog]
    [invokes social-media-manager for posts]
    [invokes visual-designer for images]
    [invokes email-specialist for campaigns]

    [coordinates all results]
    [returns complete campaign]
```

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Marketing - LinkedIn Post

```
You: "Use the social-media-manager subagent to create a LinkedIn post about autonomous AI agents"

Me: [Reading MARKETING_TEAM/.claude/agents/social-media-manager.md...]

I'll create a professional LinkedIn post for you!

[Using format_linkedin_post tool...]
[Using extract_hashtags tool...]

Here's your LinkedIn post:

ü§ñ The Future of Marketing is Autonomous

AI agents are revolutionizing how we create content. Here's what changed in 2025:

‚ú® Autonomous content generation
‚ú® Multi-agent coordination
‚ú® Personalized at scale

The question isn't IF you'll use AI agents, but WHEN.

#AIMarketing #Automation #FutureOfWork #MarTech

Would you like me to also generate a header image using the visual-designer subagent?
```

### Example 2: Testing - Generate Tests

```
You: "Use the test-orchestrator subagent to scan USER_STORY_AGENT and generate tests"

Me: [Reading TEST_AGENT/.claude/agents/test-orchestrator.md...]

I'll coordinate comprehensive test generation for USER_STORY_AGENT.

[Using scan_codebase tool...]

Found:
- 14 Python files
- 45 functions
- 12 classes

Now delegating to specialist agents:

[Invoking unit-test-agent for story_generator.py...]
[Invoking edge-case-agent for file_handlers.py...]
[Invoking fixture-agent for test data...]

‚úÖ Generated comprehensive test suite:
- tests/test_story_generator.py (15 test cases)
- tests/test_file_handlers.py (12 test cases)
- tests/test_formatters.py (8 test cases)
- tests/conftest.py (fixtures)

Coverage estimate: 87%

Would you like me to run the tests now?
```

### Example 3: Auto-Delegation

```
You: "Create a complete social media campaign about AI coding assistants"

Me: [I recognize this is a complex marketing task]
    [Automatically invoking router-agent...]
    [Router delegates to multiple specialists...]

Creating your AI coding assistants campaign:

1. [copywriter] Writing blog post (2000 words)...
2. [social-media-manager] Creating posts for X and LinkedIn...
3. [visual-designer] Generating 3 campaign images...
4. [email-specialist] Writing email sequence (3 emails)...

‚úÖ Campaign Complete!

All files saved to:
- outputs/blog_posts/ai-coding-assistants.md

## Why This Works

### What's Happening Behind the Scenes

When you say: **"Use the copywriter subagent to write a blog"**

1. **I (Claude Code) receive your request**
2. **I read** `MARKETING_TEAM/.claude/agents/copywriter.md`
3. **I see the YAML frontmatter:**
   ```yaml
   name: Copywriter
   tools:
     - mcp__marketing__get_brand_voice
   ```
4. **I read the system prompt:** "You are an expert copywriter..."
5. **I adopt that persona** - I literally become that agent
6. **I have access to those tools** - I can call get_brand_voice
7. **I follow those instructions** - "Always use get_brand_voice first..."
8. **I complete the task** in that agent's style
9. **I return results** to you

### Separate Context Windows

Each agent invocation happens in a **separate context window**:
- Preserves the main conversation
- Agent can focus on its specific task
- Can run "in parallel" (conceptually)
- Results returned to main conversation

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to run `python orchestrator.py`?
**A: NO!** Just talk to Claude Code directly. The orchestrators were a misunderstanding of how the SDK works.

### Q: What about the `Task()` function in the code?
**A: It doesn't exist.** That was aspirational code. Agent delegation happens through me reading agent definitions, not through Python code.

### Q: Can agents really call other agents?
**A: YES!** When I'm acting as router-agent and I see I need a copywriter, I invoke the copywriter subagent by reading its definition and adopting that persona.

### Q: How do I know which agents are available?
**A:** Check the `.claude/agents/` folders:
- `MARKETING_TEAM/.claude/agents/` - 13 marketing agents
- `TEST_AGENT/.claude/agents/` - 5 testing agents

### Q: Can I create my own agents?
**A: YES!** Create a new `.md` file in `.claude/agents/` with:
```markdown
---
name: My Agent
description: What this agent does
tools:
  - tool_name
---

# My Agent

You are a specialist in...
```

### Q: What if I just describe the task without mentioning an agent?
**A: I'll automatically choose the right agent** based on the task and agent descriptions!

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific in Requests
‚ùå Bad: "Make me something"
‚úÖ Good: "Use copywriter to write a blog post about AI coding assistants, 2000 words, SEO-optimized"

### 2. Use Explicit Invocation When Learning
Start with: "Use the [agent-name] subagent to..."
Once comfortable, let me auto-delegate

### 3. Let Agents Delegate
Don't micromanage: "Use router-agent to create a campaign"
Router will coordinate specialists automatically

### 4. Review Agent Definitions
Read the `.md` files to understand:
- What each agent does
- What tools they have access to
- What instructions they follow

### 5. Chain Multiple Requests
```
"Use copywriter to write a blog, then use social-media-manager to create posts about it, then use visual-designer to create images"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the agent working"
- Make sure agent `.md` files exist in `.claude/agents/`
- Check YAML frontmatter is correct
- Verify tools are registered with `@tool` decorator

### "Agent isn't using the right tools"
- Check the `tools:` list in agent YAML frontmatter
- Make sure tool is decorated with `@tool` in Python

### "Multiple agents needed but only one ran"
- Use router-agent or content-strategist for multi-agent coordination
- Or explicitly chain: "Use X, then use Y, then use Z"

---

## Quick Start Checklist

‚úÖ **Verify agents exist:**
```bash
ls MARKETING_TEAM/.claude/agents/  # Should show 13 .md files
ls TEST_AGENT/.claude/agents/       # Should show 5 .md files
```

‚úÖ **Try your first agent:**
```
You: "Use the copywriter subagent to write a short blog intro about AI"
```

‚úÖ **Try automatic delegation:**
```
You: "Create a LinkedIn post about productivity"
```

‚úÖ **Try multi-agent:**
```
You: "Use router-agent to create a mini social media campaign"
```
