## How Skills Work

**Auto-Discovery:** Claude Code automatically discovers skills in `.claude/skills/` when it starts.

**Model-Invoked:** Skills are activated automatically by Claude based on your request. You don't need to explicitly call them - just describe what you want:

```
❌ Don't say: "Use /algorithmic-art to create art"
✅ Do say: "Create a flow field generative art piece"
```

Claude will automatically choose the right skill based on your request and the skill's description.
