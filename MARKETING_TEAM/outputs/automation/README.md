# Automation Outputs

This folder stores deliverables generated by the **automation-agent** when designing, documenting, or exporting n8n workflow automations.

## Usage Guidelines
- Save workflow specifications, JSON exports, and supporting assets generated through the n8n MCP here.
- Keep sensitive API keys or credentials out of version controlâ€”store them securely outside this repository.
- Organize complex automations using subfolders (e.g., `campaign-launch/`, `lead-routing/`).
- Include a short markdown summary (`summary.md`) for each automation that explains the business process, trigger conditions, connected services, and testing status.

> Note: Only this README is tracked in git so the folder stays available while workflow files remain private by default.
