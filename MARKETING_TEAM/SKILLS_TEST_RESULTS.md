## How the Skills Work

### Model-Invoked System

Skills are **automatically activated** by Claude Code when relevant to your request. You don't need to explicitly call them.

**Example conversations:**

```
‚ùå Don't say: "Use the algorithmic-art skill to create art"
‚úÖ Do say: "Create a generative flow field art piece for social media"
```

Claude automatically:
1. Analyzes your request
2. Determines which skill is most relevant
3. Activates that skill
4. Follows the skill's instructions
5. Produces the output
