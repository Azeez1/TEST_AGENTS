## üéØ How It Works

### The Truth About Multi-Agent Systems

Your agents are **specialized personas** that I (Claude Code) adopt.

When you say:
```
"Use the copywriter subagent to write a blog about AI"
```

**What happens:**
1. I (Claude) read `.claude/agents/copywriter.md`
2. I adopt that agent's instructions and persona
3. I use the tools specified for that agent
4. I complete the task in that agent's style
5. I return results to you

**No Python orchestrator needed** - I AM the orchestrator.

---

## üß† Memory System - Automatic Configuration

**All agents automatically read configuration from memory files** - no hardcoded values!

### How It Works

1. **Each agent has a "‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files (READ FIRST)" section** in their definition
2. **Agents read memory files at task start** using the Read tool or filesystem skill
3. **Configuration is applied automatically** - emails, Drive folders, brand voice, visual styles
4. **Update once, affects all agents** - change email config, all 16 agents use it

### Memory Files (MARKETING_TEAM/memory/)

| File | Purpose | Used By |
|------|---------|---------|
| `email_config.json` | Email defaults (`user_google_email`, `default_to`, `default_cc`) | ALL agents sending emails |
| `google_drive_config.json` | Drive folder IDs for organized uploads | ALL agents uploading files |
| `brand_voice.json` | Brand tone, style, writing guidelines | copywriter, social-media-manager, email-specialist |
| `visual_guidelines.json` | Brand colors, fonts, image styles | visual-designer, presentation-designer, pdf-specialist |
| `docs_folder_structure.json` | Documentation organization (AI assistants only) | Claude Code when creating docs |

### Why This Matters

‚úÖ **No hardcoding** - Email addresses and folder IDs never hardcoded in agent definitions
‚úÖ **Consistency** - All agents use same email addresses, same Drive folders, same brand voice
‚úÖ **Easy updates** - Change one memory file, all agents benefit immediately
‚úÖ **Single source of truth** - Configuration lives in one place, not scattered across 16 files

**Example:** Change `default_to` in `email_config.json` from `user1@example.com` to `user2@example.com` ‚Üí all 16 agents now send emails to `user2@example.com` by default.

## üìù Notes

### About the Archived Orchestrator

You'll find `orchestrator.py` in the `archive/` folder. This was an earlier attempt to create a Python program that would invoke agents. **It's not needed anymore** because:

- Agent definitions are used directly by Claude Code
- No Python orchestrator required
- Simpler and more powerful to just talk to Claude

**The agent definitions (`.claude/agents/*.md`) are what matter** - they're perfectly formatted and ready to use.

5. **Experiment** - Try automatic delegation by just describing tasks
