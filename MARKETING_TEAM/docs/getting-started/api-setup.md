## üîí Security Best Practices

### Protect Your Credentials

**Never commit these files to git:**
- `.env` (contains API keys)
- `gmail_credentials.json` (OAuth secrets)
- `gmail_token.pickle` (access tokens)

**Add to .gitignore:**
```
.env
gmail_credentials.json
gmail_token.pickle
memory/
outputs/
```

### API Key Safety
- ‚úÖ Store in `.env` file
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables
- ‚ùå Never hardcode in code
- ‚ùå Never commit to version control
- ‚ùå Never share publicly

### OAuth Token Refresh
- `gmail_token.pickle` auto-refreshes
- Re-authenticate if expired (rare)
- Revoke access at: [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
