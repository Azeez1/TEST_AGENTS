## 📁 Where Are Files Saved?

**Audio Files:**
- Location: `outputs/voice_response_HHMMSS.mp3`
- Format: MP3, 44100 Hz
- Play with: VLC, Windows Media Player, or any MP3 player

**Session History:**
- Location: `memory/voice_sessions.json`
- View with: Streamlit UI (`streamlit run voice_app.py`)

---

## ✅ What Works

- ✅ Type messages to any of 17 agents
- ✅ Agent responds with text
- ✅ Audio file saved automatically
- ✅ Natural language agent detection
- ✅ Agent switching in same session
- ✅ Session persistence and memory
- ✅ Unique voice per agent

---

## ❌ What Doesn't Work (Yet)

- ❌ Real-time microphone input (threading issues)
- ❌ Live speaker output during conversation
- ❌ Voice-activated agent switching

**Why?** PyAudio callbacks run in separate threads and can't call async functions.

**Future solutions:**
- FastAPI backend with proper async handling
- Pipecat framework integration (COMING NEXT!)
- WebRTC for browser-based real-time audio

See [../guides/voice/user-guide.md](../guides/voice/user-guide.md) for technical details.
