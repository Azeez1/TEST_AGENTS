# Perplexity Research Tools - Complete Guide

## Overview

**HYBRID APPROACH:** We use BOTH custom Python tools AND working MCP tools together for maximum flexibility and redundancy.

### Why Hybrid?

1. **Redundancy** - If one system fails, fall back to the other
2. **Best Tool for the Job** - Custom tools for comprehensive research, MCP for lightweight queries
3. **Flexibility** - More options for different scenarios
4. **Future-Proof** - Ready if MCP fixes their research tool

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Custom Python Tools** - All 3 working perfectly (marketing-optimized)
- ‚úÖ **MCP perplexity_ask** - Works (conversational search)
- ‚úÖ **MCP perplexity_reason** - Works (reasoning analysis)
- ‚úÖ **MCP perplexity_search** - Works (web search)
- ‚ùå **MCP perplexity_research** - BROKEN (network error) - replaced by `conduct_research`

## üöÄ Quick Decision Guide

### "Which Tool Should I Use?"

**DEFAULT RULE:** Use `conduct_research()` for any general research UNLESS:

1. **Quick fact** (< 50 words) ‚Üí `quick_research()` or `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask`
2. **Strategic decision** ‚Üí `strategic_analysis()`
3. **Find articles/URLs** ‚Üí `mcp__perplexity__perplexity_search`

**‚ö° When in doubt:** Use `conduct_research()` - it's comprehensive and safe.

### Decision Flowchart

```
Your Research Need
    ‚Üì
Need a quick stat/fact? (< 50 words)
    YES ‚Üí quick_research() or mcp__perplexity__perplexity_ask
    NO ‚Üì

Strategic question? ("should we", "why", "compare")
    YES ‚Üí strategic_analysis()
    NO ‚Üì

Need article URLs/SERP results?
    YES ‚Üí mcp__perplexity__perplexity_search
    NO ‚Üì

DEFAULT ‚Üí conduct_research()
```

### Tool Strategy

**Primary (Custom Tools):**
- Use for comprehensive research requiring formatted output
- Marketing-optimized prompts and structure
- Better formatting than raw MCP JSON

**Backup (MCP Tools):**
- Use for lightweight queries and specialized tasks
- Fall back if custom tools fail

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY not found"
**Solution:** Add key to `MARKETING_TEAM/.env`:
```bash
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-your-key-here
```

### Error: "API request failed with status 401"
**Solution:** Invalid API key. Verify your key at perplexity.ai

### Error: "API request failed with status 429"
**Solution:** Rate limit exceeded. Wait 1 minute and try again.

### Error: "Request timed out after 60 seconds"
**Solution:** Query too complex. Break into smaller queries or simplify.

### Results not comprehensive enough
**Solution:**
- Use more specific queries
- Use `conduct_research` with "sonar-pro" instead of quick_research
- Include specific requirements in query (e.g., "include pricing data")

### Too much info, need shorter answer
**Solution:**
- Use `quick_research` instead of `conduct_research`
- Add constraints to query (e.g., "summarize in 3 key points")
