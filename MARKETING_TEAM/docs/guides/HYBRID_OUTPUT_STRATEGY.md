# Hybrid Output Management Strategy

**Date Implemented:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** Active
**Commit:** e69cd0b

## Overview

The MARKETING_TEAM now uses a **hybrid approach** for managing agent outputs, balancing privacy with collaboration and learning.

## The Three-Folder System

### 1. examples/ (Tracked in Git) ✅

**Purpose:** Curated reference materials and portfolio pieces

**Location:** `MARKETING_TEAM/examples/`

**What Goes Here:**
- Skill demonstrations (one example per skill)
- High-quality reference outputs
- Test artifacts that verify functionality
- Non-sensitive, shareable content
- Small-to-medium file sizes (< 5 MB ideal)

**Current Contents:**
- `examples/skills/algorithmic-art/data_flow_dynamics.html` - Generative flow field art

**Structure:**
```
examples/
├── README.md
└── skills/
    ├── algorithmic-art/
    ├── canvas-design/
    ├── slack-gif-creator/
    ├── theme-factory/
    ├── artifacts-builder/
    ├── internal-comms/
    ├── blog-posts/
    ├── social-media/
    ├── landing-pages/
    └── presentations/
```

**Why Tracked:**
- Version control for reference materials
- Team collaboration on examples
- Backup and restoration
- Portfolio/showcase capabilities

---

### 2. templates/ (Tracked in Git) ✅

**Purpose:** Reusable starting frameworks for common deliverables

**Location:** `MARKETING_TEAM/templates/reusable/`

**What Goes Here:**
- Blog post structures
- Social media format templates
- Landing page frameworks
- Email copywriting templates
- Campaign brief templates
- Presentation outlines

**Current Contents:**
- `blog_post_template.md` - SEO-optimized structure (1500-3000 words)
- `social_media_template.md` - Platform-specific formats (X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook)
- `landing_page_template.html` - Full conversion-focused page
- `email_template.md` - 6 email types with formulas

**Why Tracked:**
- Consistency across team
- Embed best practices
- Easy onboarding
- Version improvements over time

**How Agents Use Templates:**
```
"Use the blog post template to write about AI automation"
"Follow the landing page template structure for our SaaS product"
"Start with the email template but make it more conversational"
```

---

### 3. outputs/ (Gitignored) ❌

**Purpose:** Your actual work and production deliverables

**Location:** `MARKETING_TEAM/outputs/`

**What Goes Here:**
- Real client work
- Campaign content
- Production files
- Sensitive/proprietary content
- Large files (videos, high-res images)
- Work-in-progress drafts

**Current Contents:**
- blog_posts/ (existing campaigns)
- social_media/ (actual posts)
- images/ (generated visuals)
- videos/ (Sora outputs)
- presentations/ (client decks)
- emails/ (email sequences)
- campaigns/ (multi-asset campaigns)
- landing_pages/ (production pages)
- pdfs/ (whitepapers, reports)
- And more...

**Why Gitignored:**
- Privacy for client work
- Large file sizes (videos, images)
- Sensitive/proprietary information
- Keeps git repo lightweight
- Local-only deliverables

## Comparison Table

| Folder | Purpose | Git Tracked | Shareable | File Size | Use Case |
|--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **examples/** | Reference demos | ✅ Yes | Public | < 5 MB | "Show me what algorithmic-art can do" |
| **templates/** | Starting frameworks | ✅ Yes | Team | Small | "Use the blog template as a base" |
| **outputs/** | Real deliverables | ❌ No | Private | Any | "Generate a blog for my campaign" |

---

## Workflow Examples

### Scenario 1: Creating Content for Campaign

**Request:**
```
"Create a blog post about AI automation for our product launch"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Agent uses `templates/reusable/blog_post_template.md` as structure
2. Generates customized content
3. Saves to `outputs/blog_posts/ai_automation_launch.md` (gitignored)
4. Your work stays private

---

### Scenario 2: Testing a New Skill

**Request:**
```
"Create a generative flow field art piece to test the algorithmic-art skill"
```

**What Happens:**
1. Agent creates art using the skill
2. Initially saves to `outputs/test_algorithmic_art.html`
3. If high quality → copy to `examples/skills/algorithmic-art/data_flow_dynamics.html`
4. Example is tracked in git for future reference

---

### Scenario 3: Creating a Reusable Template

**Process:**
1. Create several campaign briefs for different projects
2. Notice common structure emerging
3. Generalize the pattern with `[PLACEHOLDERS]`
4. Save as `templates/reusable/campaign_brief_template.md`
5. Commit to git for team to use

---

## Git Configuration

### .gitignore Rules

```gitignore
# Gitignore outputs but allow examples
outputs/
**/outputs/
!examples/**

# Still gitignore large file types even in examples
*.xlsx
*.pdf
*.docx
*.pptx
```

**Effect:**
- `outputs/` folder is completely ignored
- `examples/` folder is tracked (exception rule)
- Large file types still ignored even in examples
- Templates are tracked (not in outputs/ or covered by ignore rules)

---

## Best Practices

### For Real Work (outputs/)
- ✅ Keep all production content here
- ✅ Use descriptive folder structure
- ✅ Don't worry about file sizes or privacy
- ✅ Clean up old content periodically

### For Examples (examples/)
- ✅ Only add high-quality, shareable pieces
- ✅ One example per skill/content type is enough
- ✅ Keep file sizes reasonable (< 5 MB)
- ✅ Update README when adding examples
- ❌ Don't add client work or sensitive content
- ❌ Don't add large files (use outputs/ instead)

### For Templates (templates/)
- ✅ Create templates from proven patterns
- ✅ Use `[PLACEHOLDER]` notation for variables
- ✅ Document when/how to use each template
- ✅ Update based on learnings and performance
- ❌ Don't make templates too rigid
- ❌ Don't include campaign-specific content

## Migration Notes

### What Changed

**Before:**
- Everything went to `outputs/` (gitignored)
- No templates - agents started from scratch
- No examples - no way to showcase capabilities

**After:**
- `outputs/` - Real work (still gitignored)
- `examples/` - Reference materials (tracked)
- `templates/` - Starting frameworks (tracked)

**What Stayed the Same:**
- Agents still default to `outputs/` for deliverables
- All existing content in `outputs/` untouched
- No changes to agent behavior by default

---

## FAQ

### Q: Can I change this later?
**A:** Yes! This is flexible. You can:
- Stop using examples/ (just don't copy things there)
- Track outputs/ if needed (remove from .gitignore)
- Add more template types
- Reorganize folder structure

### Q: What if I want to track all my work?
**A:** Remove `outputs/` from `.gitignore`. But consider:
- Large file sizes (videos, images) bloat git
- Private/sensitive content might get committed
- Git is better for code than binary assets

### Q: Can agents automatically use templates?
**A:** Yes, by mentioning them:
```
"Use the blog post template to write about [topic]"
"Follow the landing page template structure"
```

### Q: How do I add a new example?
**A:**
1. Generate content in `outputs/` first
2. Review for quality and privacy
3. Copy to appropriate `examples/skills/` subfolder
4. Update `examples/README.md`
5. Commit to git

### Q: Should I share examples publicly?
**A:** Up to you! Since examples are tracked in git:
- If repo is private → examples stay private
- If repo is public → examples become portfolio
- You control repo visibility
