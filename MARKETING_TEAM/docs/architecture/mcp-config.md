---

## ‚úÖ What Was Configured

### 1. Official Perplexity MCP Server

**Package:** `@perplexity-ai/mcp-server`
**Source:** Official Perplexity AI (github.com/perplexityai/modelcontextprotocol)
**Type:** NPX-based MCP server

**Capabilities:**
- Real-time web search with citations
- Advanced research with up-to-date information
- Multiple search modes (general, academic, news, finance, tech)
- Powered by Perplexity's Sonar models

**Configuration:**
```json
"perplexity": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["@perplexity-ai/mcp-server"],
  "description": "Official Perplexity AI research with citations and real-time web data",
  "env": {
    "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

**API Key:** Already configured in `.env`

---

### 2. Microsoft Office MCP (OfficeMCP)

**Package:** `officemcp` (Python)
**Version:** 1.0.5
**Type:** Python-based MCP server

**Capabilities:**
- Microsoft Word automation (create, edit documents)
- Excel automation (spreadsheets, data manipulation)
- PowerPoint automation (presentations, slides)
- Full COM interface access to Office applications

**Configuration:**
```json
"office": {
  "command": "python",
  "args": ["-m", "officemcp"],
  "description": "Microsoft Office automation (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)"
}
```

**Requirements:**
- Microsoft Office installed on system (Windows/Mac)
- `officemcp>=1.0.5` in requirements.txt

**Note:** While this is technically a third-party package, it's the recommended and most robust solution for local Office automation. Microsoft's official MCP servers focus on M365 cloud services, not local COM automation.
