## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **MCP Servers Configured**

**All 4 MCPs are NOW in `.claude.json`:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {...},              // ✅ Browser automation
    "google-workspace": {...},         // ✅ Docs, Sheets, Calendar
    "perplexity": {...},               // ✅ AI research
    "google-drive": {...}              // ✅ File uploads
  }
}
```

**All 4 MCPs are enabled in `.claude/settings.local.json`:**
```json
"enabledMcpjsonServers": [
  "playwright",
  "google-drive",
  "google-workspace",
  "perplexity"
]
```

---

### 2. **API Keys Configured**

**Root `.env` file:**
```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=372031098860-...
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=GOCSPX-...
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-1OtFZuZOABg...  # ✅ ADDED
```

**MARKETING_TEAM/.env file:**
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # For GPT-4o and Sora-2
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=pplx-...
```

### 3. **router-agent Fixed**

**Before (BROKEN):**
```yaml
tools:
  - mcp__marketing__classify_intent      # ❌ Doesn't exist
  - mcp__marketing__select_agents        # ❌ Doesn't exist
  - mcp__marketing__get_conversation_history  # ❌ Doesn't exist
```

**After (FIXED):**
```yaml
tools:
  - classify_intent                      # ✅ Real tool from router_tools.py
  - get_agent_capabilities               # ✅ Real tool from router_tools.py
  - list_available_agents                # ✅ Real tool from router_tools.py
  - format_agent_response                # ✅ Real tool from router_tools.py
```

### 4. **Python Dependencies Installed**

```bash
✅ reportlab==4.4.4 (PDF generation)
✅ python-pptx (PowerPoint generation)
```
