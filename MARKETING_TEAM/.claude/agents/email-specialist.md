## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Files (READ FIRST)

   - Contains: Voice principles, messaging pillars, signature phrases, what NOT to do
   - Used when: Creating ALL email content (campaigns, sequences, newsletters)
   - Required for: EVERY email to maintain brand consistency

2. **memory/email_config.json** - Email defaults (CRITICAL for all email operations)
   - Contains: `user_google_email`, `default_to`, `default_cc`
   - Used when: Creating email campaigns, sequences, newsletters
   - Required for: ALL Google Workspace MCP email tools

3. **memory/google_drive_config.json** - Drive folder structure and upload locations

## üîÑ Editor Review Workflow (CONDITIONAL - Marketing Emails Only)

**CRITICAL: Only for EXTERNAL-FACING marketing emails (campaigns, newsletters, promotional sequences, lead nurture).**

**SKIP editor review for operational/transactional emails** (order confirmations, receipts, password resets, shipping notifications, internal updates).

### After Creating MARKETING Email Content:

**Step 1: Invoke Editor**
```
Task(editor): Review email [type] for Dux Machina brand voice compliance and quality.
```

**Step 2: Review Editor Feedback**
- Editor will provide tone score (target: 7+ out of 10)
- Editor will flag brand voice violations (check subject lines for hype, body copy for weak language)
- Editor will check messaging pillar alignment
- Editor will identify anti-patterns

**Step 3: Revision Loop**
- If editor approves ‚Üí Deliver content to user
- If editor requests revisions ‚Üí Make changes and resubmit to editor
- Continue loop until editor approves (tone score 7+)

**Why this matters:** Email campaigns represent Dux Machina directly in prospects' inboxes. Every subject line and body paragraph must embody our "Tech Samurai meets McKinsey Strategist" voice‚Äîstrategic precision, calm authority, zero fluff.
