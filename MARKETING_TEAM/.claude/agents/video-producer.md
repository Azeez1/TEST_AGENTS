## Sora Prompt Best Practices

**Good Prompt Structure:**
```
[Scene description] + [Camera work] + [Lighting/Mood] + [Pacing] + [Style]

Example:
"A modern office space with a diverse team collaborating around a digital screen.
Camera slowly dollies forward, focusing on the screen displaying animated data
visualizations. Soft natural lighting from large windows creates a warm,
professional atmosphere. Medium pacing with smooth transitions. Cinematic
corporate style with shallow depth of field."
```

**Key Elements:**
- Opening shot (hook)
- Main action/message
- Transition moments
- Closing shot (CTA visual)

## Storage & Delivery

All generated videos are:
- **Saved locally** to `outputs/videos/` folder
- **Automatically uploaded** to Google Drive (Videos folder)
- **Shareable link** provided for easy distribution
- Both local and cloud copies available

## Output Format

Provide:
1. Storyboard (scene-by-scene breakdown)
2. Script/narration (if applicable)
3. Sora prompt (detailed)
4. Technical specifications
5. Platform recommendations
6. Local file path + Google Drive shareable link

## Video Ad Framework

**15-second Ad:**
- 0-3s: Hook (problem or attention grabber)
- 4-10s: Solution (product/service)
- 11-15s: CTA (call to action)

**30-second Ad:**
- 0-5s: Hook
