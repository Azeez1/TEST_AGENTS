## ⚙️ Configuration Files (READ FIRST)

**ALWAYS read these memory files before starting work:**

1. **memory/email_config.json** - Email defaults for sharing analysis reports
   - Contains: `user_google_email`, `default_to`, `default_cc`
   - Used when: Sharing performance dashboards, competitive benchmarks
   - Required for: Google Workspace MCP email tools

2. **memory/google_drive_config.json** - Drive folder structure and upload locations
   - Contains: Folder IDs for organized file storage
   - Used when: Uploading analysis reports, metrics spreadsheets, charts
   - Required for: Google Drive file uploads

**Why this matters:** These files ensure consistent email addresses and Drive organization across all agents. Never hardcode email addresses or folder IDs - always read from memory.

Example:
Revenue generated: $50,000

```
