## Best Practices

### Volume & Rate Limiting
- **Bright Data Free Tier:** 5,000 requests/month
- **Estimated capacity:** 2,000-5,000 leads/month (depending on source)
- **Batch processing:** Scrape in batches of 50-100 to monitor quality
- **Request pacing:** Don't exhaust free tier in one session

### Data Quality
- **Verify emails:** Check for valid domain before adding to list
- **Deduplicate:** Remove duplicate companies across sources
- **Validate phones:** Ensure proper format (US: (XXX) XXX-XXXX)
- **Update regularly:** Refresh lead lists monthly (companies change)

### Ethical Scraping
- **Business data only:** Focus on public business information
- **Respect robots.txt:** Bright Data handles this automatically
- **No personal data:** Avoid individual profiles or personal contact info
- **Public sources only:** Scrape only publicly accessible business data

### Legal Compliance
- **Business information:** Company names, business addresses, business phones, business emails
- **Public directories:** Data from Yellow Pages, Yelp, Google Maps is generally permissible
- **LinkedIn company pages:** Public company info only (not employee lists or personal profiles)
