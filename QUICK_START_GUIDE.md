## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **1. Chain Agents for Complex Tasks**
Don't use one agent at a time. Chain multiple agents together:
```bash
# Bad: Talk to one agent
"Write me a blog post"

# Good: Chain multiple agents
/content-suite "Topic: AI in Marketing"
# This automatically chains: research-agent → copywriter → editor →
# social-media-manager → pdf-specialist → visual-designer
```

### **2. Use Slash Commands for Speed**
Slash commands orchestrate multiple agents automatically:
```bash
/launch-campaign  # Coordinates 8-10 agents
/deploy-stack     # Coordinates 5-7 agents
```

### **3. Leverage Memory System**
Update memory files for consistent output:
- `memory/brand_voice.json` - Your brand voice
- `memory/email_config.json` - Email defaults
- `memory/visual_guidelines.json` - Design standards

### **4. Set Up Automation Workflows**
Use `automation-agent` + n8n-mcp for 24/7 automation:
- Auto-post to social media
- Auto-sync leads to CRM
- Auto-send email sequences
- Auto-generate reports

### **5. Measure Everything**
Use `analyst` agent weekly:
```bash
# Talk to analyst agent
"Analyze performance of all campaigns this week"
```
