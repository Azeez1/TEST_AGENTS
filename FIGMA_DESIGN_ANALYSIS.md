## User Flow

```
1. Initial Screen (Login/Create Account)
   ↓
2. [Interaction State/Hover]
   ↓
3. [Processing/Loading/Error]
   ↓
4. [Success/Next Step]
```

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Strategy
- OAuth 2.0 with Google as identity provider
- Single sign-on (SSO) implementation
- No visible traditional email/password fields (Google-first approach)

### Responsive Design
- Designed for MacBook Pro 14" (likely 1512x982 viewport)
- Likely responsive across devices
- Modern web standards

## Recommendations for User Story Generation

When generating user stories from this design, consider:

### 1. Authentication Stories
- As a user, I want to log in with Google so that I can access the platform quickly
- As a user, I want to create an account so that I can use the service
- As a user, I want accessible login options so that I can authenticate regardless of ability

### 2. Accessibility Stories
- As a screen reader user, I want proper ARIA labels so that I can navigate the login flow
- As a keyboard user, I want to navigate without a mouse so that I can log in efficiently
- As a user with vision impairment, I want high contrast UI so that I can read content easily

### 3. Security Stories
- As a user, I want secure OAuth authentication so that my credentials are protected
- As a user, I want session management so that I stay logged in appropriately
- As a developer, I want to implement OAuth 2.0 correctly so that authentication is secure

### 4. UI/UX Stories
- As a user, I want a clean login interface so that I'm not overwhelmed
- As a user, I want clear CTAs so that I know what action to take
- As a user, I want responsive design so that I can log in from any device

## Design Patterns Identified

### 1. **Single Sign-On (SSO) First**
Pattern: Google OAuth as primary authentication method
Benefits: Faster onboarding, fewer passwords, trusted identity provider

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Pattern: Simple initial screen, likely expanding to more options if needed
Benefits: Reduces cognitive load, focuses user attention

### 3. **Accessibility-First Design**
Pattern: Skip links, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
Benefits: WCAG compliant, inclusive design

### 4. **Minimal UI**
Pattern: Clean, focused design with single primary action
Benefits: Clear user path, reduced decision fatigue

## Color Palette (Estimated)

- **Primary Action:** Google Blue (#4285F4)
- **Background:** White/Light Gray (#FFFFFF / #F5F5F5)
- **Text:** Dark Gray/Black (#333333 / #000000)
- **Accent:** Various UI states (hover, focus, active)

---

## Component Specifications

### Primary Button (Google Sign-In)
- **Type:** Solid button with icon
- **Label:** "Continue with Google"
- **Icon:** Google logo
- **Size:** Large (likely 48px height minimum)
- **Style:** Rounded corners, Google brand colors
- **States:** Default, Hover, Active, Focus, Disabled

### Header
- **Text:** "High-Fidelity Prototype for User Stories"
- **Position:** Top of page
- **Alignment:** Left or center
- **Style:** Bold, prominent

### Heading
- **Text:** "Log in or create account"
- **Level:** H1 or H2
- **Position:** Above primary action
- **Style:** Clear, direct language

---

## Interaction Patterns

### Keyboard Navigation
- **Arrow Right (→):** Next screen
- **Arrow Left (←):** Previous screen
- **R:** Restart prototype
- **Tab:** Focus navigation
- **Enter/Space:** Activate buttons

### Mouse Interaction
- **Click:** Primary action
- **Hover:** Visual feedback
- **Focus:** Keyboard accessibility

## Browser Automation Insights

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Password Protection:** Required form fill and button click
2. **iFrame Embedding:** Prototype runs in iframe, complicating element selection
3. **Overlay Elements:** Interactive overlays intercept clicks
4. **Dynamic Content:** Content loads asynchronously

### Solutions Applied
1. **Password Entry:** Successfully filled password input and clicked Continue
2. **Keyboard Navigation:** Used arrow keys instead of mouse clicks (more reliable)
3. **Screenshot Capture:** Captured all 4 screens successfully
4. **Text Extraction:** Extracted visible text for context

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

### For Developers
1. Implement Google OAuth 2.0 integration
2. Create responsive layout matching designs
3. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
4. Add proper ARIA labels and roles
5. Implement keyboard navigation
6. Add loading and error states

### For QA/Testing
1. Test OAuth flow end-to-end
2. Verify accessibility with screen readers
3. Test keyboard-only navigation
4. Verify responsive behavior across devices
5. Test error handling and edge cases

### For Product
1. Define user flows beyond login
2. Specify error messages and copy
3. Define analytics/tracking requirements
4. Plan for account recovery flows
5. Consider multi-factor authentication
