For each user story, also provide:
1. Feature/Epic name (concise feature title)
2. Detailed Acceptance Criteria in Gherkin format (Given/When/Then)
   - Include at least 4-6 acceptance criteria per story
   - Cover happy path, edge cases, error handling, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility
   - Each AC should be specific and testable
3. Rationale or Business Case (explain the business value and impact)
4. Relevant Page(s) (which pages/screens/areas this affects)

Format the output as a JSON array with objects containing:
- user_story: The user story text
- feature_epic: The feature/epic name
- acceptance_criteria: Array of acceptance criteria strings (each in Given/When/Then format)
- business_case: The rationale/business case
- relevant_pages: The relevant pages/screens

Make sure all acceptance criteria are detailed and follow this pattern:
"Given [context], when [action], then [expected outcome]"

Consider edge cases like:
- Missing or invalid data
- Mobile/tablet responsiveness
- Accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Error states and recovery
- Performance considerations
- Cross-browser compatibility (if web-based)"""
